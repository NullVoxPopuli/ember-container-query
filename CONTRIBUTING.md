<details>
<summary>Linting</summary>

1. When you write code, please check dependencies, template files, and JavaScript files often.

    ```

    This command will lint files and dependencies in parallel.

<summary>Running tests - very important ‚ö†Ô∏è</summary>

1. The setup is quite different from most addons. We check the addon and demo app at _9_ various widths and heights.

1. When you write code, please check both addon and demo app often.

    ```bash
    yarn test
    ```

1. A couple of caveats. `yarn test --server` may not run properly (i.e. opening 9 browsers and shutting them down). If you do want to check something in browser, you can run one script at a time:

    ```bash
    yarn test:ember:w3-h3 --server
    ```

    Using `--filter` will result in failed tests. I use the filters for responsive testing so please don't overwrite them with your own.

1. When you write code, you don't need to check addon compatibility. I suggest leaving this to CI. For every PR, the CI will lint files and dependencies, run tests, and check compatible versions‚Äîall in parallel! üíØ
